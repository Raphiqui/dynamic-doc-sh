# dynamic-doc-sh
When using shell scripts it might be annoying to document it 

Generating a template using tags might be interesting (a bit like how swagger handles the integration for the API).

Tags are applied before the line which need to be entered as documentation then the script needs to run to generate or override a `.md` file which is the actual dynamic documentation.

There are multiple type of Tag.
